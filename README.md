# Problem Solving with Go
Welcome to go-problems, a repository dedicated to solving coding problems on multiple platforms in Go backed by unit tests! The repository is a work in progress and may not contain the most optimal solution to a problem.

## Contents
### Docs
In docs you can find a breakdown of concepts that help you solve a class of problem. The explanations behind the concept tries to stay language agnostic but the examples and implementations will be written in Go to help apply the knowledge to the language.
### Platforms
Each platform will contain a subdirectory of problem topics and their solutions. Subdirectories do their best to group problems in a way that's most similar to the platform's grouping.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcomed! If you would like to add to the collection of solutions or have a bug fix feel free to make a PR :blush:
